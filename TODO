Soon:
- Looking up Admin Action Pages by IP
- Get player list by IP
- Auto ban people attempting to bypass bans
	- Link auto bans to initial bans (Possibly to other player?) so they can be unbanned when
	the probation ends or when either is unbanned
- Add alternate account field to player table (ties into banning for ban evasion)

Later:
- Spout interface
- PHP interface
